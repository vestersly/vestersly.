## 🎯 Professional Focus

I am a **security-first engineer** with long-term experience in **high-pressure operational environments**, now fully focused on **cybersecurity, Linux systems, and secure cloud infrastructure**.

My work emphasizes:
- disciplined security thinking  
- operational reliability under stress  
- responsible disclosure and confidentiality  

I build systems that are secure **by design, by operation, and by mindset**.

## 🔐 Security Baseline — The CIA Triad

Every technical decision I make is grounded in the **CIA Triad**:

| Principle | Engineering Focus |
|---------|------------------|
| 🔒 **Confidentiality** | Least privilege, access control, data protection |
| 🧾 **Integrity** | Change detection, system trust, verifiable states |
| ⚙️ **Availability** | Resilience, fault tolerance, operational continuity |

CIA defines **what must be protected** and **why**.

## 🧊 The McCumber Cube — Making Security Real

To move from theory to **real-world security**, I apply the **McCumber Cube**, ensuring security is addressed across **technology, process, and people**.

### 🧰 Technology & Implementation
- Linux system hardening and secure configuration  
- Patch management and continuous monitoring  
- Defense against known **and unknown** vulnerabilities  

### 🧭 Process & Governance
- Security embedded into operational workflows  
- DevSecOps and change control discipline  
- Proactive threat modeling  

### 🧠 People & Awarenes
